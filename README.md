# Notchie

A simple in-browser notch filter built with the Elementary Audio JS library. Accepts an audio file from the user, which is processed with a predefined freq. automation pattern. User can adjust the the amount of the effect while triggering/looping the audio preview. Output files are rendered in the same format as the input.
