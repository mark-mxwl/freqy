### Freqy is a multimode filter built with the Web Audio API.

🔥 Accepts an audio file of up to 10 MB in the following formats: wav, aiff, and mp3.

⚡️ Audio can be triggered as a one-shot or loop, and can be replaced at any time.

🦾 Four filter modes: Classic (LP), DJ Booth (HP), Trip-Hop (BP), and Nu-Skool (Notch). 

👾 Cutoff can be controlled with the main knob, frequency display, or via MIDI.

> [!NOTE]
> All of Freqy's features are fully accessible with keyboard navigation.

> [!TIP]
> Connect a MIDI device to control Freqy via knobs, sliders, ribbons, etc.
