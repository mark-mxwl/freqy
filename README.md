# Notchy

Notchy is an in-browser notch filter built with the Web Audio API. The filter's audio buffer accepts an audio file of up to 10 MB in the following formats: wav, aiff, and mp3. The audio can then be triggered as a one-shot or loop, allowing the user to adjust the cutoff frequency in realtime.
